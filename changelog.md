# Week 5
## Week 5, Wednesday 3/April [Henry]
- This project needs more work to meet the pass hurdle.
- Switch single line comments (//) to multi-line comments (/* */) before each function, to outline what the function does, any arguments and return types, and how to use it.

# Week 6
## Week 6, Monday 8/April [Henry]
- This changelog is missing dates. - Updated
- Both of you: function comments. I made a big fuss about this on the unit site last week. [Henry] _ updated
- Most of your work so far is in static descriptions, which should usually be in separate text / HTML files and loaded in (eg description of diets). Program code is for ACTIONS, for DOING THINGS. Static text belongs in plain files, not program code.
- You both need a minimum 2 days per week to pass under normal circumstances. 
- I need to get serious with you here: To catch up, you'll need to do much more. If you're not intending to pass, look into withdrawing from the unit and trying again next year.

## Week 6, Thursday 11/April [Henry]
- This changelog is missing dates. Who did the work yesterday? What was changed? You need to tell everyone (in this project, just your teammate and myself) what you changed on any day you worked and committed code, so they're kept up to date.
